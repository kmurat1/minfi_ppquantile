# The normalization procedure is applied to the Meth and Unmeth intensities separately. The distribution of type I and type II signals is forced to be the same by first quantile normalizing the type II probes across samples and then interpolating a reference distribution to which we normalize the type I probes. Since probe types and probe regions are confounded and we know that DNAm distributions vary across regions we stratify the probes by region before applying this interpolation.
